        <h1> Leaning Tower of Pisa </h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(0, 247, 255); font-family: lucida calligraphy; font-size: 22px;"> 
            There has been controversy surrounding the identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
             For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 
             12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa 
             Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. 
             A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be 
             related to the bronze door in the fa√ßade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study
              seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and 
              affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, 
              both in Pisa.

            Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta 
            di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi
            to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few 
            stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[9] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the 
            tower were laid.[10] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of 
            the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind 
            arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals. Nearly four centuries
             later Giorgio Vasari wrote: "Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, 
             together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa".

            Between 1589 and 1592, Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped 
            two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was 
            independent of their mass, in keeping with the law of free fall. The primary source for this is the
             biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of 
             Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only 
             published in 1717, long after his death. During World War II, the Allies suspected that the 
             Germans were using the tower as an observation post. Leon Weckstein, a U.S. Army sergeant sent to 
            confirm the presence of German troops in the tower, was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral 
            and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from 
            destruction.

            The tower has survived at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. A 2018 engineering 
            investigation concluded that the tower withstood the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure 
            interaction: the height and stiffness of the tower combined with the softness of the foundation 
            soil influences the tower's vibrational characteristics in such a way that it does not resonate 
            with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the tower to 
            the verge of collapse helped it survive.

            Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lopsided building: 
            the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of 
            Bad Frankenhausen. Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the 
            former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees. In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital 
            Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the "World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower"; it has an 
            18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Tower of Pisa, but was deliberately engineered to 
            slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to 
            the ground.
